# tic-tac-toe-game
 Homework project for Mobile Web Development Course

📋 Description
A browser-based Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports a human vs. computer experience and includes basic turn logic, win detection, and UI interaction.

🔧 Features
- User can click to place "X" on their turn
- Computer auto-selects a square after the player
- Game detects win, loss, or draw
- Game board resets with a “New Game” button
- Accessible via keyboard and visually clean

🧩 My Role
In this project, I implemented several key functions, including:
- boardButtonClicked() – Handles player clicks and updates UI
- switchTurn() – Manages turn transitions and win/draw logic
- makeComputerMove() – Selects a random valid move for the computer
- Debugged logic for win detection and player state toggling
- Ensured semantic class usage and clean UI updates
This was part of a Web Development course with University of Phoenix, where I learned core JavaScript techniques for DOM interaction and state control.
